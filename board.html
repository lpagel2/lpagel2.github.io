            <h2>Board of Directors</h2>
            <p>The day to day operations of the PF HOA are run by an all-volunteer Board <br>
                of Directors, along with help from many other committee volunteers. The <br>
                Board establishes the annual dues assessment and is responsible for using <br>
                the money assessed to maintain and improve HOA property and offer programs <br>
                which are of value to Prairie Fields residents, thereby increasing the <br>
                value of the neighborhood. <br>
            
            Welcome new board members Brian Kesler and Kyle Kirchhoefer and returning board <br>
             members Greg Sopa, and Tim Yardley. <br>
