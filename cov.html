                <h3>About the Covenants</h3><br>
                <p>Covenants are legal documents that lay out the guidelines for the planned community. <br>
                The Covenants are recorded in the county records in the county where the property is located <br>
                and are legally binding. This means that when you purchase a lot or a home in Prairie Fields <br>
                you automatically become a member of the HOA.  The Covenants, which were established by the <br>
                builder, are the rules of the Prairie Fields neighborhood. They govern what you can, cannot,<br>
                 or must do with respect to your home.</p><br>
                
                <h3>Which covenants apply to my phase?</h3><br>
                <p>Each covenant applies to a single Phase. See the Prairie Field Phase page to find out what <br>
                    Phase your house belongs to.  To access the Covenant files, click here.</p><br>
                
                <h3>How are covenants enforced?</h3><br>
                   <p> At the 9/20/10 Board of Directors meeting, the Board officially approved a Covenant Enforcement Policy.<br>
                  The purpose of the policy is to clarify the way in which the Board plans to enforce covenants, and to,<br>
                   clarify the procedures for enforcement of the covenants.  At this time, only complaints which <br>
                   are brought to the Board and which comply with the policy will be acted on.</p><br>
                
                <h3>Form to request covenant enforcement</h3><br>
                <p>Covenants will be enforced by the Board if there is a specific complaint submitted to the board according to the <br>
                Covenant Enforcement Policy.  If you would like to make a complaint or covenant enforcement request to the HOA Board,<br>
                please fill out the Covenant Enforcement Form.  Note that the information submitted will not be published on this<br>
                website, but it will be used by the Board of Directors as they investigate the complaint.</p><br>
