<h2>Now accepting Board of Directors applications</h2>
<h3>10/24/2017</h3>
 
<p>If you are interested in running for a seat on the PF HOA Board of Directors, you can download an  application form here. <br>

The day to day operations of the PF HOA are run by an all-volunteer Board of Directors, along with help from many other <br> 
committee volunteers.  The Board establishes the annual dues assessment and is responsible for using the money assessed <br> 
to maintain and improve HOA property and offer programs which are of value to Prairie Fields residents, thereby increasing <br>
the value of the neighborhood.  If you have 1-2 hours a month to donate to the neighborhood, you are encouraged to run one <br>
of the 3 upcoming vacancies on the Board for a term which begins January 1, 2018 and runs through December 31, 2019. <br>
Applications must be submitted by November 10. <br>

This year, voting will be conducted electronically.  You can opt for paper ballots by dropping a note in the HOA dropbox. <br>
 Homeowners must be a member in good standing to vote in the election, and not owe the association more than $10.  <br>
  You can access the past due list by clicking here. <br>

For more information, please email board@prairiefieldshoa.com </p>

Planning <br>
We will be planning at the next HOA Board meeting at Carrie Busey Elementary on Monday, November 14th at 8pm. <br> 
If you'd like to help out in any capacity of the planning please attend. <br>

Treat Tables - If you'd like to host, please e-mail board@prairiefieldshoa.com <br>
We will be looking for folks to provide and monitor the treat tables/voting stations. Each table will be given <br> 
$30 to purchase the treats. We would like to focus on having these tables stationed at corners throughout the <br>
neighborhood to make it easy for visitors to find. This year we are looking to have ballot style voting sheets <br>
that people can carry with them as they look at the houses.<br> 

PRIZES! <br>
As was the case last year, there will be trophies for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Place as well as honorable mention ribbons.<br>
 We will also have a fun prize for one random participating house!</p>
